The [[Request Header]] that indicates the initiator of the original [[Javascript Fetch]] request. 
The sec-fetch-dest indicates what source sent this. If any other source sent this not within the list, then the GET is ignored.
For example, if we send a GET within a document, then we set a header:
```
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
```
